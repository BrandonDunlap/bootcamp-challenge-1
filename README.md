# Bootcamp Challenge 1

## Purpose

The purpose of this code is to refactor the original code for the company Horiseon to make it more accessible and follow industry best practices. Refactoring of the code increases search engine optimization and readability for any future developer working in the code base.

## Original Code

The original code did not contain alt attributes for images and was using non-semantic language that hurt both accessibility and search engine optimization.

## Screenshots

Below are screenshots for what the code looks like displayed in a live server.
